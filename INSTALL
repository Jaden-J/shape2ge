shape2ge requires:

    - Python (tested with 2.5)
    - shapelibc (tested with 1.2.10)
    - pyshapelibc (tested with 0.3)

shapelibc can be found from http://freshmeat.net/projects/shapelib
pyshapelibc can be found at http://ftp.intevation.de/users/bh/pyshapelib

shape2ge has been tested on Slackware 12 using kernel 2.6.21.5

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In short:

 - type "make"
 - put
    ./standalone/shape2ge-frontend.py 
    ./standalone/pyshape2ge-engine.py
   somewhere in your path

Long Story:

I don't like the way python forces you to install every piece of code you need
to share as a system-wide module. (import only looks in the current dir and in
the system dir). You can make import look in different places by setting
environment variables before running your app, but IMO this sucks.

So "make" removes local module "import" lines from the sources and cats the
required source files into a big hunk of python code.

This creates the apps in the ./standalone folder (in the C world these would
be equivalent to linked binaries).

This does mean that local modules have to import *, but I think it is worth it
