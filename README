What is it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shape2ge is a set of two applications to convert ESRI ShapeFiles into Google
Earth KML files. shape2ge consists of a frontend and an engine.

    - shape2ge-engine.py is a batchable converter engine that does the actual
      conversion. It reads conversion options from a XML config file generated
      by shape2ge-frontend.py or other methods.
    - shape2ge-frontend.py is a CLI-based frontend that helps you generate the
      conversion options used by the engine. This allows you set scales and
      offsets (from shapefile coords to earth coords), and also to assign
      different display styles to different feature types.

Why another one?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few similar programs on the web. The nicest one is called
"Shape2Earth" and has a very nice GUI with stacks of options. Other projects
like shp2kml are also available

The problem with the above is that they don't script or batch well. With
shape2ge it is possible to generate one config file for a whole class of
shapefiles and then to convert all the shapefiles in a script using the same
config file.

For example, I have ~3000 shapefiles containing 20m contour data for South
Africa. With shape2ge I can generate one config file for the whole set and then
batch convert the whole lot (with some help from bash).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I use it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ shape2ge-frontend.py -o <configfile> <shapefile>

You should supply the name of the <shapefile> without the .SHP extension
Follow the prompts and you will end up with your conversion options in
<configfile>

then:

$ shape2ge-engine.py -c <configfile> <shapefile>

<configfile> is the name of the file generated by the frontend.
You should supply the name of the <shapefile> without the .SHP extension
This will leave a .kml file in the current folder with the same base name as
the <shapefile>.

then:

$ googleearth <kmlfile>

and youre shapefile should be visible in Google Earth

Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Both the frontend and the engine look in the current folder for a .DBF file
with the same base name as the .SHP file, and while it should be possible to do
a conversion without the DBF file this is not handled by shape2ge currently.

* Since the frontend is very simple at the moment, one might be inclined to
generate the XML config file by hand. This is not a bad option, and inspection
of a frontend-generated config file should give enough information about the
required format.

* The error handling on the config file parser is very weak, so if the engine
does not find all the tags it is looking for it will probably die a horrible
screaming death.

* The engine currently only supports ARC,ARCZ,POLYGON,POLYGONZ,POINT/POINTZ
object types. The frontend currently only supports ARC,ARCZ,POLYGON/POLYGONZ.
